# Green Eggs and Ham

- Run the code with: `ruby test_green_eggs_and_ham.rb`
- You may only edit the code in the `green_eggs_and_ham.rb` file
- Make the first test pass
  - You will need to define methods in `green_eggs_and_ham.rb`
  - You will have to add code to these methods to compute the correct
    values the tests are indicating.
  - Don't just return the number the test expects, write code that works out the answer.
  - Remember there are many enumerable methods besides `each`. See if there is an existing enumerable that will help do what you need (along with some code in the block it takes)
- Remove the 'skip' from the next test in the `test_green_eggs_and_ham.rb`
- Repeat previous step until all tests are passing
- Profit
- Have fun
